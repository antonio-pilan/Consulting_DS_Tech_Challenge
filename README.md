<h1>Consulting Tech Challenge</h1> 

<p>Hello! My name is Antonio, and this is my repository for the Consulting challenge that optimize costs in a company that runs Trucks.</p>
<p>The Jupyter Notebook "bix_tecnologia_psel_AntonioPilan" contains the code and development of the XGBoost model, which achieved a cost of $17,900 on the test data. This is significantly lower than the cost reported for the first year (2016), and overall, the result was very satisfactory.</p>

<hr>
<p>The $17,900 cost was achieved by setting false positives at $25, aiming for a conservative approach while minimizing false negatives (which are extremely costly).</p>
<p>The entire code was written in Python, with an execution time of approximately 18 hours, involving extensive research, trial and error, and valuable learning experiences.</p>
